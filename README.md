A python-based  application for secure **Data Hiding** using **LSB**. This tool allows users to hide a secret image inside a cover image, extract hidden data, and calculate image quality metrics such as **PSNR** and **SSIM**.

🛠️ Installation & Requirements:
Ensure you have Python 3.6+ and the following libraries:
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-image

🧪 Workflow
1. Upload a cover image and a secret image.
2. Click Hide Secret Image to embed and save it.
3. Use Extract Secret Image to retrieve the hidden image from an encrypted one.
4. Optionally, click Calculate Metrics to compare quality differences (SSIM, PSNR).
